# UrbanOS-PoC

UrbanOS-PoC is a **Proof of Concept** built on the [Sovereign, Self-Healing AI Architecture](https://github.com/pablo-chacon/Sovereign-Self-Healing-AI/blob/main/README.md). 

---

*‚ÄúTransit isn‚Äôt just supply. It‚Äôs supply + human behavior. UrbanOS is the first system that optimizes the human side in real-time, without stress or coercion.‚Äù*  
‚Äî *Emil Karlsson, Creator of UrbanOS and Sovereign, Self-Healing AI*

---

It is **sovereign** because:
- Hardware agnostic: runs on commodity CPUs, containers, and cloud/on-prem equally well.  
- No humans in the loop: no prompts, no manual decision-making, fully automated.  
- Decisions are based only on **machine data**, not human input.  

It is **self-healing** because:  
- Operates a **26h Machine Learning / Deep Learning loop** that continuously re-learns from trajectories, POIs, patterns, and hotspots.  
- Adjusts routing and predictions to deviations automatically.  
- Never requires human intervention to maintain consistency.  

UrbanOS-PoC targets **Urban Flow**: minimizing friction for residents, operators, and planners.  
Compatible with virtually any **IoT unit** and **API**.  

Currently the PoC integrates **Stockholm‚Äôs Lokaltrafik (SL)** public transport feeds via [Trafiklab](https://www.trafiklab.se/):  
- Static GTFS: [GTFS Regional](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/gtfs-datasets/gtfs-regional/#realtime-data)  
- GTFS-RT (Samtrafiken Open Data):  
  - Service Alerts ‚Üí `https://opendata.samtrafiken.se/gtfs-rt/{operator}/ServiceAlerts.pb?key={apikey}`  
  - Trip Updates ‚Üí `https://opendata.samtrafiken.se/gtfs-rt/{operator}/TripUpdates.pb?key={apikey}`  
  - Vehicle Positions ‚Üí `https://opendata.samtrafiken.se/gtfs-rt/{operator}/VehiclePositions.pb?key={apikey}`

**Simulation**:
- Recommended minimum clients 100 to ensure enough data. 
- **MQTT IoT Stream Simulation** pre-release test 250 clients in 5 min.
- **MQTT Bulk Simulation** pre-release test 100 clients in 3 min.
- [Locust MQTT simulation scripts](https://github.com/pablo-chacon/mqtt-simulations/blob/main/README.md)

## Quickstart

Run the PoC locally with Docker Compose.

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/pablo-chacon/urbanos-poc.git
cd urbanos-poc

# Copy environment file (edit with your own DB/API keys)
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build

# Check container health
docker-compose ps

# Verify Postgres is ready
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"

# Run health checklist
./health.sh uos_full/uos_full --stop-on-fail
```

The API will be available at:
üëâ `http://localhost:8181/api/`

Example endpoints:

* `/api/trajectories` ‚Üí migrated client trajectories
* `/api/pois` ‚Üí detected Points of Interest
* `/api/view_astar_eta` ‚Üí A\* routing with ETA
* `/api/view_predicted_routes_schedule` ‚Üí weekly schedule predictions

---

## API Examples

Test the API with simple `curl` calls:

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest trajectories
curl -s http://localhost:8181/api/trajectories | jq

# 2. Get predicted POIs sequence (next likely destinations)
curl -s http://localhost:8181/api/predicted_pois_sequence | jq

# 3. Query A* routes with ETA
curl -s http://localhost:8181/api/view_astar_eta | jq
```

üëâ All responses are returned as JSON. Use `jq` (or any JSON viewer) for pretty-printing.
